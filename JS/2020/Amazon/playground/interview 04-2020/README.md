Hi Mo

Thank you so much for taking time to speak with me today! It was great to talk with another New Yorker. :)

Here is the link for the software development engineer application so we can continue with this process:

As for the next step, it will consist of an online assessment.

You will receive an invitation to participate in an Online Coding Assessment.
I will send the Coding Exercise once your application is completed – please check your spam for this is you do not see it come through!
· You will have up to 90 minutes to complete two coding questions focused on data structures and algorithms. Please do your best to manage your time to work through both questions.
o I recommend brushing up on applying data structures and algorithm to solve problems.
· You may find these links helpful to prepare for the online assessment as well:

As soon as you complete the assessment and the results are reviewed by the team, next steps will be communicated.

Please let me know when it would be most convenient for you to take this assessment. If you have any questions regarding the process or the position, please feel free to ask. I look forward to hearing back from you soon!

Best,
Emily
